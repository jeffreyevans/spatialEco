\usage{
hli(x, check = TRUE, force.hemisphere = c("none", "southern", "northern"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{terra SpatRaster class object}

\item{check}{(TRUE/FALSE) check for projection integrity and
calculate central latitude for non-geographic
projections}

\item{force.hemisphere}{If country is split at the equator, force southern 
or northern hemisphere equation c("southern", "northern")}
}

terra SpatRaster class object of McCune & Keon (2002) Heat Load Index
}
\description{
Calculates the McCune & Keon (2002) Heat Load Index
}
\details{
Describes A southwest facing slope should have warmer temperatures than a 
southeast facing slope, even though the amount of solar radiation they receive 
is equivalent. The McCune and Keon (2002) method accounts for this by "folding" 
the aspect so that the highest values are southwest and the lowest values are  
northeast. Additionally, this method account for steepness of slope, which is 
not addressed in most other aspect rescaling equations. HLI values range 
from 0 (coolest) to 1 (hottest). 

The equations follow McCune (2007) and support northern and southern hemisphere 
calculations. The folded aspect for northern hemispheres use (180 - (Aspect – 225) ) 
and for Southern hemisphere  ( 180 - ( Aspect – 315) ). If a country is split at the 
equator you can use the force.hemisphere argument to choose which equation to use. 
Valid values for this argument are "southern" and "northern" with the default "none".
