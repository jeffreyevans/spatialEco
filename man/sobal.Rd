\description{
An isotropic image gradient operator using a 3x3 window

The Sobel-Feldmanh operator is a discrete differentiation operator, deriving an 
approximation of the gradient of the intensity function. abrupt discontinuity 
in the gradient function represents edges, making this a common approach for edge 
detection. The Sobel-Feldman operator is based on convolving the image with a small, 
separable, and integer matrix in the horizontal and vertical directions. The operator 
uses two 3x3 kernels which are convolved with the original image to calculate 
approximations of the derivatives - one for horizontal changes, and one for vertical. 
Where x is defined here as increasing in the right-direction, and y as increasing in 
the down-direction. At each pixel in the raster, the resulting gradient can be combined 
to give the gradient intensity, using: SQRT( Gx^2 Gy^2 ). This can be expanded into the 
gradient direction using atan(Gx/Gy)
